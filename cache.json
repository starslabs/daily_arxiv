In the context of low-resource (LR) MT between two\nclosely-related languages, a natural intuition is to seek benefits from\nstructural \"shortcuts\", such as copying subwords from the source to the target,\ngiven that such language pairs often share a considerable number of identical\nwords, cognates, and borrowings. We test Pointer-Generator Networks for this\npurpose for six language pairs over a variety of resource ranges, and find weak\nimprovements for most settings. However, analysis shows that the model does not\nshow greater improvements for closely-related vs. more distant language pairs,\nor for lower resource ranges, and that the models do not exhibit the expected\nusage of the mechanism for shared subwords. Our discussion of the reasons for\nthis behaviour highlights several general challenges for LR NMT, such as modern\ntokenization strategies, noisy real-world conditions, and linguistic\ncomplexities. We call for better scrutiny of linguistically motivated\nimprovements to NMT given the blackbox nature of Transformer models, as well as\nfor a focus on the above problems in the field.\n","authors":["Niyati Bafna","Philipp Koehn","David Yarowsky"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.10963v2.pdf","comment":"4 pages"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16702v1","updated":"2024-03-25T12:34:33Z","published":"2024-03-25T12:34:33Z","title":"ProCQA: A Large-scale Community-based Programming Question Answering\n  Dataset for Code Search","summary":"  Retrieval-based code question answering seeks to match user queries in\nnatural language to relevant code snippets.

Many sought to mitigate this by restricting the\nattention window within the pre-trained length. However, these methods\nintroduce new issues such as ignoring the middle context and requiring\nadditional training. To address these problems, we propose LongHeads, a\ntraining-free framework that enhances LLM's long context ability by unlocking\nmulti-head attention's untapped potential. Instead of allowing each head to\nattend to the full sentence, which struggles with generalizing to longer\nsequences due to out-of-distribution (OOD) issues, we allow each head to\nprocess in-distribution length by selecting and attending to important context\nchunks. To this end, we propose a chunk selection strategy that relies on the\ninherent correlation between the query and the key representations, efficiently\ndistributing context chunks to different heads. In this way, each head ensures\nit can effectively process attended tokens within the trained length, while\ndifferent heads in different layers can collectively process longer contexts.\nLongHeads works efficiently in linear time, fits seamlessly with many LLMs that\nuse relative positional encoding. LongHeads achieves 100% accuracy at the 128k\nlength on passkey retrieval task, verifying LongHeads's efficacy in extending\nthe usable context window for existing models.

This approach not only efficiently preserves contextual knowledge\nbut also prevents any permanent alteration to the model's parameters given that\nthe module is discarded post-generation.

To evaluate the capabilities of code\nLLMs in various aspects, many benchmarks have been proposed (e.g., HumanEval\nand ClassEval). Code reasoning is one of the most essential abilities of code\nLLMs, but existing benchmarks for code reasoning are not sufficient. Typically,\nthey focus on predicting the input and output of a program, ignoring the\nevaluation of the intermediate behavior during program execution, as well as\nthe logical consistency (e.g., the model should not give the correct output if\nthe prediction of execution path is wrong) when performing the reasoning. To\naddress these problems, in this paper, we propose a framework, namely REval,\nfor evaluating code reasoning abilities and consistency of code LLMs with\nprogram execution. We utilize existing code benchmarks and adapt them to new\nbenchmarks within our framework.

Previous research has aimed to lower the complexity by sparsifying\nor linearly approximating the attention matrix.

To address these challenges, we propose SEA: Sparse linear attention\nwith an Estimated Attention mask. SEA estimates the attention matrix with\nlinear complexity via kernel-based linear attention, then subsequently creates\na sparse attention matrix with a top-k selection to perform a sparse attention\noperation. For language modeling tasks (Wikitext2), previous linear and sparse\nattention methods show roughly two-fold worse perplexity scores over the\nquadratic OPT-1.3B baseline, while SEA achieves better perplexity than\nOPT-1.3B, using roughly half the memory of OPT-1.3B, providing interpretable\nattention matrix.

Position\nEmbedding (PE) scaling methods, while effective in extending the context window\nto a specific length, demonstrate either notable limitations in their\nextrapolation abilities or sacrificing partial performance within the context\nwindow. Length extrapolation methods, although theoretically capable of\nextending the context window beyond the training sequence length, often\nunderperform in practical long-context applications. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Continuous Length EXtrapolation (CLEX) for LLMs. We\ngeneralise the PE scaling approaches to model the continuous dynamics by\nordinary differential equations over the length scaling factor, thereby\novercoming the constraints of current PE scaling methods designed for specific\nlengths. Moreover, by extending the dynamics to desired context lengths beyond\nthe training sequence length, CLEX facilitates the length extrapolation with\nimpressive performance in practical tasks.

One commonly recognized factor for this\nphenomenon is the model's familiarity with the given prompt or instruction,\nwhich is typically estimated by its perplexity. However, finding the prompt\nwith the lowest perplexity is challenging, given the enormous space of possible\nprompting phrases. In this paper, we propose monotonic paraphrasing (MonoPara),\nan end-to-end decoding strategy that paraphrases given prompts or instructions\ninto their lower perplexity counterparts based on an ensemble of a paraphrase\nLM for prompt (or instruction) rewriting, and a target LM (i.e. the prompt or\ninstruction executor) that constrains the generation for lower perplexity. The\nensemble decoding process can efficiently paraphrase the original prompt\nwithout altering its semantic meaning, while monotonically decreasing the\nperplexity of each generation as calculated by the target LM. We explore in\ndetail both greedy and search-based decoding as two alternative decoding\nschemes of MonoPara. Notably, MonoPara does not require any training and can\nmonotonically lower the perplexity of the paraphrased prompt or instruction,\nleading to improved performance of zero-shot LM prompting as evaluated on a\nwide selection of tasks.

A circuit is faithful if\nall model edges outside the circuit can be ablated without changing the model's\nperformance on the task; faithfulness is what justifies studying circuits,\nrather than the full model.

While\nspeculative and parallel decoding techniques attempt to mitigate this, they\nface limitations: either relying on less accurate smaller models for generation\nor failing to fully leverage the base LLM's representations.\n  We introduce a novel architecture, Tandem transformers, to address these\nissues. This architecture uniquely combines (1) a small autoregressive model\nand (2) a large model operating in block mode (processing multiple tokens\nsimultaneously). The small model's predictive accuracy is substantially\nenhanced by granting it attention to the large model's richer representations.\nOn the PaLM2 pretraining dataset, a tandem of PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko\ndemonstrates a 3.3% improvement in next-token prediction accuracy over a\nstandalone PaLM2-Gecko, offering a 1.16x speedup compared to a PaLM2-Otter\nmodel with comparable downstream performance. We further incorporate the tandem\nmodel within the speculative decoding (SPEED) framework where the large model\nvalidates tokens from the small model. This ensures that the Tandem of\nPaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko achieves substantial speedup (around 1.14x faster\nthan using vanilla PaLM2-Gecko in SPEED) while maintaining identical downstream\ntask accuracy.\n","authors":["Aishwarya P S","Pranav Ajit Nair","Yashas Samaga","Toby Boyd","Sanjiv Kumar","Prateek Jain","Praneeth Netrapalli"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08644v3.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17599v1","updated":"2024-03-26T11:09:58Z","published":"2024-03-26T11:09:58Z","title":"Coimagining the Future of Voice Assistants with Cultural Sensitivity","summary":"  Voice assistants (VAs) are becoming a feature of our everyday life.

Current solutions to this issue involve altering the probability\ndistribution of candidate words, rendering them incompatible with provably\nsecure steganography. We propose a novel secure disambiguation method named\nSyncPool, which effectively addresses the segmentation ambiguity problem. We\ngroup all tokens with prefix relationships in the candidate pool before the\nsteganographic embedding algorithm runs to eliminate uncertainty among\nambiguous tokens. To enable the receiver to synchronize the sampling process of\nthe sender, a shared cryptographically-secure pseudorandom number generator\n(CSPRNG) is deployed to select a token from the ambiguity pool. SyncPool does\nnot change the size of the candidate pool or the distribution of tokens and\nthus is applicable to provably secure language steganography methods.

This challenge is even more for regional\nBengali dialects due to unavailability of standardized spelling conventions for\nthese dialects, presence of local and foreign words popular in those regions\nand phonological diversity across different regions. This paper presents an\napproach to this sequence-to-sequence problem by introducing the District\nGuided Tokens (DGT) technique on a new dataset spanning six districts of\nBangladesh. The key idea is to provide the model with explicit information\nabout the regional dialect or \"district\" of the input text before generating\nthe IPA transcription. This is achieved by prepending a district token to the\ninput sequence, effectively guiding the model to understand the unique phonetic\npatterns associated with each district. The DGT technique is applied to\nfine-tune several transformer-based models, on this new dataset. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of DGT, with the ByT5 model achieving\nsuperior performance over word-based models like mT5, BanglaT5, and umT5.

TDT systems aim to cluster a corpus of news articles by event,\nand in that context, stories that describe the same event are likely to have\nbeen written at around the same time. Prior work on time modeling for TDT takes\nthis into account, but does not well capture how time interacts with the\nsemantic nature of the event. For example, stories about a tropical storm are\nlikely to be written within a short time interval, while stories about a movie\nrelease may appear over weeks or months. In our work, we design a neural method\nthat fuses temporal and textual information into a single representation of\nnews documents for event detection. We fine-tune these time-aware document\nembeddings with a triplet loss architecture, integrate the model into\ndownstream TDT systems, and evaluate the systems on two benchmark TDT data sets\nin English. In the retrospective setting, we apply clustering algorithms to the\ntime-aware embeddings and show substantial improvements over baselines on the\nNews2013 data set. In the online streaming setting, we add our document encoder\nto an existing state-of-the-art TDT pipeline and demonstrate that it can\nbenefit the overall performance. We conduct ablation studies on the time\nrepresentation and fusion algorithm strategies, showing that our proposed model\noutperforms alternative strategies.

Investigating and Mitigating Prompt Bias\n  in Factual Knowledge Extraction","summary":"  Recent research shows that pre-trained language models (PLMs) suffer from\n\"prompt bias\" in factual knowledge extraction, i.e., prompts tend to introduce\nbiases toward specific labels. Prompt bias presents a significant challenge in\nassessing the factual knowledge within PLMs. Therefore, this paper aims to\nimprove the reliability of existing benchmarks by thoroughly investigating and\nmitigating prompt bias. We show that: 1) all prompts in the experiments exhibit\nnon-negligible bias, with gradient-based prompts like AutoPrompt and OptiPrompt\ndisplaying significantly higher levels of bias; 2) prompt bias can amplify\nbenchmark accuracy unreasonably by overfitting the test datasets, especially on\nimbalanced datasets like LAMA. Based on these findings, we propose a\nrepresentation-based approach to mitigate the prompt bias during inference\ntime. Specifically, we first estimate the biased representation using\nprompt-only querying, and then remove it from the model's internal\nrepresentations to generate the debiased representations, which are used to\nproduce the final debiased outputs. Experiments across various prompts, PLMs,\nand benchmarks show that our approach can not only correct the overfitted\nperformance caused by prompt bias, but also significantly improve the prompt\nretrieval capability (up to 10% absolute performance gain). These results\nindicate that our approach effectively alleviates prompt bias in knowledge\nevaluation, thereby enhancing the reliability of benchmark assessments.\nHopefully, our plug-and-play approach can be a golden standard to strengthen\nPLMs toward reliable knowledge bases.

The\ncomparative method, one of the most influential theoretical and methodological\nframeworks in the history of the language sciences, allows linguists to infer\nprotoforms (reconstructed ancestral words) from their reflexes (related modern\nwords) based on the assumption of regular sound change. Not surprisingly,\nnumerous computational linguists have attempted to operationalize comparative\nreconstruction through various computational models, the most successful of\nwhich have been supervised encoder-decoder models, which treat the problem of\npredicting protoforms given sets of reflexes as a sequence-to-sequence problem.\nWe argue that this framework ignores one of the most important aspects of the\ncomparative method: not only should protoforms be inferable from cognate sets\n(sets of related reflexes) but the reflexes should also be inferable from the\nprotoforms.

Most of the existing works focus on improving\nthe representation ability for the contextualized embedding of the [CLS] token\nand calculate relevance using textual semantic similarity. However, in the\nlegal domain, textual semantic similarity does not always imply that the cases\nare relevant enough. Instead, relevance in legal cases primarily depends on the\nsimilarity of key facts that impact the final judgment. Without proper\ntreatments, the discriminative ability of learned representations could be\nlimited since legal cases are lengthy and contain numerous non-key facts. To\nthis end, we introduce DELTA, a discriminative model designed for legal case\nretrieval. The basic idea involves pinpointing key facts in legal cases and\npulling the contextualized embedding of the [CLS] token closer to the key facts\nwhile pushing away from the non-key facts, which can warm up the case embedding\nspace in an unsupervised manner. To be specific, this study brings the word\nalignment mechanism to the contextual masked auto-encoder. First, we leverage\nshallow decoders to create information bottlenecks, aiming to enhance the\nrepresentation ability. Second, we employ the deep decoder to enable\ntranslation between different structures, with the goal of pinpointing key\nfacts to enhance discriminative ability.

This\nmethod can be generalized across word embeddings, even when they share minimal\noverlap at both vocabulary and word-substitution levels.

Studies highlight\nthe gap in the deceptive power of LLM-generated fake news with and without\nhuman assistance, yet the potential of prompting techniques has not been fully\nexplored. Thus, this work aims to determine whether prompting strategies can\neffectively narrow this gap. Current LLM-based fake news attacks require human\nintervention for information gathering and often miss details and fail to\nmaintain context consistency. Therefore, to better understand threat tactics,\nwe propose a strong fake news attack method called conditional\nVariational-autoencoder-Like Prompt (VLPrompt). Unlike current methods,\nVLPrompt eliminates the need for additional data collection while maintaining\ncontextual coherence and preserving the intricacies of the original text. To\npropel future research on detecting VLPrompt attacks, we created a new dataset\nnamed VLPrompt fake news (VLPFN) containing real and fake texts.

Current VL models\neither use lightweight uni-modal encoders and learn to extract, align and fuse\nboth modalities simultaneously in a deep cross-modal encoder, or feed the\nlast-layer uni-modal representations from the deep pre-trained uni-modal\nencoders into the top cross-modal encoder. Both approaches potentially restrict\nvision-language representation learning and limit model performance. In this\npaper, we propose BridgeTower, which introduces multiple bridge layers that\nbuild a connection between the top layers of uni-modal encoders and each layer\nof the cross-modal encoder. This enables effective bottom-up cross-modal\nalignment and fusion between visual and textual representations of different\nsemantic levels of pre-trained uni-modal encoders in the cross-modal encoder.\nPre-trained with only 4M images, BridgeTower achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on various downstream vision-language tasks. In particular, on the\nVQAv2 test-std set, BridgeTower achieves an accuracy of 78.73%, outperforming\nthe previous state-of-the-art model METER by 1.09% with the same pre-training\ndata and almost negligible additional parameters and computational costs.\nNotably, when further scaling the model, BridgeTower achieves an accuracy of\n81.15%, surpassing models that are pre-trained on orders-of-magnitude larger\ndatasets.

Most\nexisting works primarily focus on post-training and fine-tuning tailored for\ncross-encoders. However, there are no post-training methods tailored for dense\nencoders in dialogue response selection. We argue that when the current\nlanguage model, based on dense dialogue systems (such as BERT), is employed as\na dense encoder, it separately encodes dialogue context and response, leading\nto a struggle to achieve the alignment of both representations. Thus, we\npropose Dial-MAE (Dialogue Contextual Masking Auto-Encoder), a straightforward\nyet effective post-training technique tailored for dense encoders in dialogue\nresponse selection. Dial-MAE uses an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture to\ncompress the dialogue semantics into dense vectors, which achieves better\nalignment between the features of the dialogue context and response. Our\nexperiments have demonstrated that Dial-MAE is highly effective, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance on two commonly evaluated benchmarks.\n","authors":["Zhenpeng Su","Xing Wu","Wei Zhou","Guangyuan Ma","Songlin Hu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.04357v5.pdf","comment":"This paper has been accepted by NAACL 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00868v2","updated":"2024-03-27T03:03:00Z","published":"2024-03-01T04:39:16Z","title":"SoftTiger: A Clinical Foundation Model for Healthcare Workflows","summary":"  We introduce SoftTiger, a clinical large language model (CLaM) designed as a\nfoundation model for healthcare workflows.
